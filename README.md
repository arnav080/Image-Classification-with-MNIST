# Image Classification with MNIST Dataset
This project is a basic image classification model developed using TensorFlow and Keras. The model is trained on the popular MNIST dataset, which consists of handwritten digit images.

## Dataset
The MNIST dataset is a collection of 60,000 training images and 10,000 testing images of handwritten digits (0-9). Each image is a grayscale image with a resolution of 28x28 pixels.

## Model Architecture
#### Hidden Layer (Dense Layer 1): 
Activation Function: ReLU (Rectified Linear Unit), Number of Neurons: 512

#### Output Layer (Dense Layer 2):
Activation Function: Softmax, Number of Neurons: 62
